# Purpose of Mandates is Power & Control, Not Safety

These vaccine mandates and restrictive public health policies are solely about power and control, not about safety.

In a meeting of key leaders at Vancouver Coastal Health, Dr. Patty Daly, Chief Medical Health Officer for Vancouver
Coastal Health, was asked these questions and gave these answers (15:30 to 17:00 of the video) https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1NlhQGVAhw

> Question: “We aren’t allowing unvaccinated people into restaurants, but they are still allowed to visit patients in Acute
care (ICU, etc.). Is this true? If so, what are the risks?”

> Answer: “Maybe I can answer this just briefly. The vaccine passport requires people to be vaccinated to do certain
discretionary activities such as go to restaurants, movies, gyms, not because these places are high risk. We are not
actually seeing covid transmission in these settings. Its really is to create an incentive to improve our vaccination
coverage…The vaccine passport is for non-essential opportunities, and its really to create an incentive to get
higher vaccination rates.”

US agencies are conecting vaccine passport apps to financial credit profiles https://archive.is/m5JMH
