# Covid Death is Extremely Rare in People Under 50 Without Comorbidities

Media and government agencies repeatedly allege that vaccine injuries are extremely rare.  The problem is that covid death is also extremely rare in people under 50 without comorbidities, so low rates of serious vaccine injuries can easily exceed covid complications.

For example, mortality data from UK PHE shows the following https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.05.06.20092999v1

* for people under 40 years old including with comorbidities, there were only 40 deaths in roughly 6 million cases = 0.000666666% mortality rate
* for people aged 40-49 including those with comorbidities, the mortality rate was only 0.003268927%

In most western countries, people under 50 are consistently over 60% or even 70% of the population, meaning for the majority of populations, covid mortality is extremely rare.

# Real World Vaccine Injury Comparisons

Taiwan finds vaccine deaths exceed covid deaths https://www.ntd.com/more-die-after-vaccination-than-from-covid-19-in-taiwan_688004.html raw data https://www.cdc.gov.tw/Uploads/c9fb07bf-6881-4198-b864-849a3bc9b61f.pdf

At the FDA hearing on safety and boosters, multiple panelists presented massive amounts of data showing serious and often fatal side effects from the vaccine... then the FDA openly admitted the risk to males under 40 from only one of the vaccine's side effects exceeds all covid risk.  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WFph7-6t34M&t=23315s

Dr. Arnold Monto, Acting FDA Chair:

>And to continue the discussion, is it possible to say at what age myocarditis seems to not become a problem?

Dr. Doran Fink, FDA:

>If you look at the healthcare claims data, you see that there is evidence of some attributable risk at all age groups, although ***the older you get, the higher the risk for complications from covid that then offset the risk of myocarditis.  So when you look at the balances of risks vs benefits, where we really start to see a risk of myocarditis being higher is in males under the age of 40.***

Further, this is not based on unverified VAERS data.  The CDC researched VAERS reports of carditis and verified the stark majority of reported cases: https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/acip/meetings/downloads/slides-2021-08-30/03-COVID-Su-508.pdf#page=13

> Reports among persons 12â€“29 years of age were verified by provider interview of medical record review

The BBC also admits the vaccines are more dangerous than covid for many people, particularly young people https://www.bbc.com/news/health-57888429 and data from UK PHE supports that https://preview.redd.it/vliojmym4sr71.jpg?width=960&crop=smart&auto=webp&s=74547070b334e82fa5ff576af71d29ee23130435. The BBC continues: 

> Data for England suggests about 25 children died from Covid in the first 12 months of the pandemic.  The majority of them also had severe health problems, including complex neurodisabilities.  Only six had no recorded health conditions.

Measurable excess mortality not from covid is also spiking across Europe with the vaccine rollout https://www.rintrah.nl/too-many-people-are-dying-and-its-starting-to-worry-the-demographers/ raw data: https://www.euromomo.eu/graphs-and-maps#excess-mortality

# Bans & Suspensions on Vaccines

Iceland banned Moderna outright.  https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-10-08/iceland-joins-nordic-peers-in-halting-moderna-covid-vaccinations

Sweden and Finland suspended Moderna for people under 30, Norway for people under 18 https://www.bmj.com/content/375/bmj.n2477.  Denmark also suspended Moderna for people under 30.  https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/finland-pauses-use-moderna-covid-19-vaccine-young-men-2021-10-07/. 

However, CDC data shows Pfizer has similar rates of carditis to Moderna for people under 25 and significantly greater rates of carditis for people under 18 https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/acip/meetings/downloads/slides-2021-08-30/03-COVID-Su-508.pdf#page=13
