A May 2020 meta-study on pandemic influenza published by the US CDC found that face masks had no effect, neither as personal protective equipment nor as a source control. https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/eid/article/26/5/19-0994_article

A Danish randomized controlled trial with 6000 participants, published in the Annals of Internal Medicine in November 2020, found no statistically significant effect of high-quality medical face masks against SARS-CoV-2 infection in a community setting. https://www.acpjournals.org/doi/10.7326/M20-6817

A large randomized controlled trial with close to 8000 participants, published in October 2020 in PLOS One, found that face masks “did not seem to be effective against laboratory-confirmed viral respiratory infections nor against clinical respiratory infection.” https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0240287

A February 2021 review by the European CDC found no high-quality evidence supporting the effectiveness of non-medical and medical face masks in the community. Furthermore, the European CDC advised against the use of FFP2/N95 masks by the general public. https://www.ecdc.europa.eu/sites/default/files/documents/covid-19-face-masks-community-first-update.pdf

A July 2020 review by the Oxford Centre for Evidence-Based Medicine found that there is no evidence for the effectiveness of face masks against virus infection or transmission. https://www.cebm.net/covid-19/masking-lack-of-evidence-with-politics/

A November 2020 Cochrane review found that face masks did not reduce influenza-like illness (ILI) cases, neither in the general population nor in health care workers. https://www.cochrane.org/CD006207/ARI_do-physical-measures-such-hand-washing-or-wearing-masks-stop-or-slow-down-spread-respiratory-viruses

An April 2020 review by two US professors in respiratory and infectious disease from the University of Illinois concluded that face masks have no effect in everyday life, neither as self-protection nor to protect third parties (so-called source control). https://www.cidrap.umn.edu/news-perspective/2020/04/commentary-masks-all-covid-19-not-based-sound-data

An article in the New England Journal of Medicine from May 2020 came to the conclusion that face masks offer little to no protection in everyday life. https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMp2006372

A 2015 study in the British Medical Journal BMJ Open found that cloth masks were penetrated by 97% of particles and may increase infection risk by retaining moisture or repeated use. https://bmjopen.bmj.com/content/5/4/e006577

An August 2020 review by a German professor in virology, epidemiology and hygiene found that there is no evidence for the effectiveness of face masks and that the improper daily use of masks by the public may in fact lead to an increase in infections. https://www.thieme-connect.com/products/ejournals/html/10.1055/a-1174-6591

States and country comparisons repeatedly show no evidence of mask effectiveness https://ianmsc.substack.com/p/the-more-masks-fail-the-more-we-need

Covid case quiz shows how perception on mask effectiveness is not reflected in data https://www.covidchartsquiz.com/state-vs-state

August 2021 study "hypothesized that statewide mask mandates and mask use were associated with lower COVID-19 case growth rates" but found they "did not observe association between mask mandates or use and reduced COVID-19 spread in US states". https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.05.18.21257385v1.full-text

# Masks and Exercise

https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32590322/ November 2020 study regarding exercising in masks found it causes hypercapnic hypoxia and

> hypercapnic hypoxia may potentially increase acidic environment, cardiac overload, anaerobic metabolism and renal overload, which may substantially aggravate the underlying pathology of established chronic diseases. Further contrary to the earlier thought, no evidence exists to claim the facemasks during exercise offer additional protection from the droplet transfer of the virus.

https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15340662/ found in 2004 while studying SARS

> Wearing an N95 mask for 4 hours during HD significantly reduced PaO2 and increased respiratory adverse effects in [end-stage renal disease] patients.
