# "Covid Deaths" number is statistically meaningless

The current definition in most western nations on "covid deaths" does not mean what most people think it means.  Most people *think* "covid death" means someone who died *because* of covid.  This is not accurate.

The exact definition varies, but in most western countries, the general definition of "covid death" means:
* anyone who died and tested positive within the recent 1-2 months (depends on the country) OR
* anyone who died recently and a medical professional opined the death involved covid.

The exact standards vary from country to country, but the point is that nowhere does this actually require that covid **caused** the death, and in most cases, no positive test is actually even required.

Dr. Birx explaining that "covid deaths" are just deaths with recent cases of covid, regardless of cause of death.  https://www.realclearpolitics.com/video/2020/04/08/dr_birx_unlike_some_countries_if_someone_dies_with_covid-19_we_are_counting_that_as_a_covid-19_death.html

UK Public Health reiterates the same https://publichealthmatters.blog.gov.uk/2020/08/12/behind-the-headlines-counting-covid-19-deaths/

> For several months, the COVID-19 Data Dashboard has been reporting, for England, all deaths in people who have a positive test.

Instead of including proximate cause analyses, PHE-UK expanded the exact metric to more specifically define a better time limit.

> The additional indicators which will be used to calculate daily death figures are:
> the number of deaths in people with COVID-19 that occur within 28 days of a first positive laboratory-confirmed test. ...
> the number of deaths that occur within 60 days of a first positive test. Deaths that occur after 60 days will also be added to this figure if COVID-19 appears on the death certificate

This is why in many data reports, PHE-UK and the NHS are using a metric called "Deaths within 28 days of positive specimen date"

Covid need not actually be a proximate cause of death to be included as a "covid death".

# Excess Deaths

The "excess deaths" number *should* be taken by analyzing the actual death totals by death certificate count, aggregated by day or week, and comparing those to prior years.  

This is *not* what the CDC data reflects though.  

The CDC is not posting the atomic deaths counts.  Instead, the CDC has chosen to publish some data aggregated by causes of death (rather than individual deaths) for certain causes of death.  There is no way to calculate overlaps of deaths or even raw daily or weekly death counts.  

Instead, the "excess deaths" number from the CDC takes the daily and weekly counts of death certificates including the word "covid" and adds that to historical estimates from other causes. https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/eid/article/27/3/20-3925_article and https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/nvss/vsrr/covid19/excess_deaths.htm  The CDC uses a "quasi-Poisson regression" estimate for excess deaths, not actual death certificate counts, summed by time period, compared to the prior year stats.
