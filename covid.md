### Vaccine Efficacy

CDC director admits vaccines fail to prevent transmission https://web.archive.org/web/20210805232759/https://www.cnn.com/us/live-news/coronavirus-pandemic-vaccine-updates-08-05-21/h_d2accec79fdc37f422d02c536828ea1e

Moderna's EUA admits it has no data on effectiveness over time, or reducing transmission, or for long-term effectives of covid, or on reducing covid death https://www.fda.gov/media/144434/download#page=48

Pfizer's clinical III (RCT) shows 90%+ reduction in covid cases and substantial drop in severe cases, but zero evidence of reduction in covid deaths with poor p-val of 0.28 in vaccinated vs unvaccinated.  https://www.medrxiv.org/content/medrxiv/early/2021/07/28/2021.07.28.21261159/DC1/embed/media-1.pdf

Pfizer's clinical II data for their EUA admits it has no data on effectiveness over time, or reducing transmission, or for long-term effectives of covid, or on reducing covid death https://www.fda.gov/media/144245/download#page=46

UK's observational shows (1) lower case fatality in under-50 unvaccinated, (2) higher case fatality in over-50 vaccinated  https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/1009243/Technical_Briefing_20.pdf#page=18
* Under 50 vaccinated = 13 deaths in 25,536 cases = 0.0509% case fatality rate
* Under 50 unvaccinated = 48 deaths in 147,612 cases = 0.0325% case fatality rate
* Over 50 vaccinated = 389 deaths in 21,472 cases = 1.812% case fatality rate
* Over 50 unvaccinated = 205 deaths in 3,440 cases = 5.959% case fatality rate

Half life of the pfizer vax is 68 days, below clinical effectiveness after 198 days https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.07.27.21261237v1

### Vaccine Side Effects

Pfizer's clinical III suggests vaccine is causative for substantial increase in fatal heart issues (p-vals of 0.95-0.97) that it's roughly 2-3x higher than the risk of covid death in both vaccinated and unvaccinated  https://www.medrxiv.org/content/medrxiv/early/2021/07/28/2021.07.28.21261159/DC1/embed/media-1.pdf

HHS sponsored Harvard study that found <1% of all adverse vaccine events are reported to VAERS https://www.icandecide.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Lazarus-report.pdf while VAERS is reporting 12k deaths, 14k permanent disabilities, 45k hospitalizations, and over 68k visits to emergency care, associated with covid vaccines https://www.medalerts.org/vaersdb/findfield.php?TABLE=ON&GROUP1=CAT&EVENTS=ON&VAX=COVID19

### Mutations and Variants

Stronger variants come from ineffective vaccines, not the unvaccinated http://europepmc.org/article/PMC/4516275

Dr Geert Vanden Bossche, a world leading vaccinologist for Gates Foundation, warns we never use leaky vaccines because of "immune escape" causing endemic mutations https://twitter.com/GVDBossche/status/1368232172872732675

### Poor Data Quality

Pfizer's clinical II data for their EUA admits roughly 95% of the covid infections in both placebo and vaccinated groups are presumed as "suspected but unconfirmed" as they did not have positive PCR tests https://www.fda.gov/media/144245/download#page=42

Pfizer's clinical II data for their EUA includes unexplained 5x increase (311 vs 60) in withdrawal for vaccinated over unvaccinated "prior to 7 days after dose 2" https://www.fda.gov/media/144245/download#page=18


### Vaccine Support

NYPD only 43% vaxed in July 2021 https://nypost.com/2021/07/21/nypd-lags-in-vaccinating-cops-as-delta-covid-variant-spreads/

The UN admitted one of the largest remaining groups of the "vaccine hesitant" are those with higher level scientific education and experience, who "have read the primary literature themselves, and they’re correctly interpreting it, so it’s not a misunderstanding." https://digitallibrary.un.org/record/3894424


# Natural Immunity

11 large studies with over 615k participants unanimously found reinfection rate was 0-1.1% with negligible loss at 10+ months (the max duration of the studies) https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8209951/pdf/RMV-9999-e2260.pdf

Cleveland Clinic study of 52k healthcare workers finds vaccine associated with lower risk in those not previously infected, but no evidence of risk reduction in previously infected. over 5 months, recorded 2579 infected, 1359 not vaccinated since infection, zero reinfections in both groups.  https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.06.01.21258176v2

Antibody testing fails to reflect immunity once the infection subsides.  https://science.sciencemag.org/content/371/6529/eabf4063

# Masks

Biden's senior director admits on CNN that masks don't work for covid https://twitter.com/ClayTravis/status/1422261427210006541

California data shows no evidence masks have any effect https://ianmsc.substack.com/p/los-angeles-just-showed-masks-dont

# Ivermectin

89 patient RCT shows ivermectin effective for treating covid https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.05.31.21258081v1

All 8 states of Peru running mass ivermectin trials show collapse in covid deaths in age 60+ patients immediately following deployment of mass ivermectin treatment https://twitter.com/SandmanRT/status/1368367083386503170/photo/1

# Social Impact of Pandemic Policy

### Vaccine Mandates and Racism

75% of american blacks are unvaccinated as of July 2021 https://thehill.com/policy/healthcare/562125-racial-disparities-in-covid-19-vaccination-rates-persist-as-delta-variant  [SECONDARY]

Black Americans are justified in not trusting the US government https://i.redd.it/luro7nf87tf71.jpg [OPINION]

Boston mayor Kim Janey called vaccine mandates racist, NYC mayor Bill de Blasio labeled her comments "inappropriate" https://nypost.com/2021/08/05/de-blasio-calls-boston-mayor-racist-vax-comments-inappropriate/

### On Children

Pandemic lockdown reduces child IQ subtantially.

> In general, we find mean ELC values from 2011 to 2019 ranging from 98.5 to 107.3, with standard deviations of 15.2 to 19.7, in general agreement with the expected mean of 100 and standard deviation of 15. Means and standard deviations for 2020 (March to December) and 2021 (January through Aug) were: 86.3+/-17.9 and 78.9+/-21.6, respectively. Controlling for differences in age and maternal education, we find inconsistent differences in mean ELC between 2011-2019 and 2020, but consistent and significant reductions between 2011-2019 and 2021 (p<0.001). Results are similar for the verbal and non-verbal composite measures. https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.08.10.21261846v1.full.pdf
