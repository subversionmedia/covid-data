The purpose of this project is to reduce misinformation by collecting and consolidating empirically replicable data with minimal editorialization.

Information must come from an authoritative primary source for the truth of the matter asserted where possible.  

Secondary sources are subject to replacement at any time from a primary source.

Opinions are often not relevant on scientific matters and will not be included.  Opinions may be relevant on social matters (e.g. racism, sexism, discrimination) if they represent substantially popular opinions.

# Contributions

In order to contribute, include a primary source, and a quote if possible, or short summary if not available (usually tables are not quotable).      Minimize editorializing as much as possible.  Then submit a pull request.
